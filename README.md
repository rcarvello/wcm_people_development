# People Development
An open source project that implements the "People Development" pillar of the World Class Manufacturing Protocol.

## Introduction

World Class Manufacturing (**WCM**) is a comprehensive, systematic approach to improve all aspects of a manufacturing operation. It focuses on continuous improvement, waste elimination, and achieving world-class production standards across all areas, from safety to customer service, and from equipment management to employee development. The goal is to achieve a "**zero waste**" state in terms of defects, downtime, accidents, and customer dissatisfaction. 

Here's a more detailed breakdown:

**Key Principles:**

 - **Continuous Improvement**: WCM emphasizes ongoing efforts to identify and eliminate waste, improve processes, and increase efficiency.
 - **Holistic Approach**: It encompasses all aspects of the manufacturing operation, from the shop floor to management practices. 
 - **Focus on the Customer:** WCM prioritizes meeting customer needs and expectations, ensuring on-time delivery and high-quality products. 
 - **Zero Waste**: The ultimate goal is to eliminate all forms of waste, including defects, downtime, accidents, and inventory, to achieve optimal efficiency and reduce costs. 
 - **Employee Involvement:** WCM encourages the active participation of all employees in identifying and implementing improvements. 

**Core Elements:**
WCM is often organized around 10 key pillars, including:

 1. Safety: Ensuring a safe working environment.  
 2. Cost Deployment:    Identifying and addressing cost-related losses.  
 3. Focus Improvement:   Implementing targeted improvement projects. 
 4. Autonomous Maintenance:   Empowering operators to maintain equipment.  
 5. Professional Maintenance: Implementing a structured maintenance program.  
 6. Quality  Control: Ensuring product quality through statistical process  control.
 7. Logistic/Customer Services: Managing supply chains and meeting customer needs.  
 8. Early Equipment Management: Making informed decisions about equipment purchases and maintenance.  
 9. Environment: Minimizing environmental impact.  
 10. **People Development**: Investing in employee skills and training.

**7-Step Implementation Process:**
Each pillar is implemented through a 7-step process, moving from reactive to preventive and ultimately proactive approaches. 

The **People Development** pillar is one of the foundational elements of **World Class Manufacturing (WCM)**. It focuses on empowering and developing employees to support continuous improvement and operational excellence. 

Here's a breakdown of the **basic requirements** for implementing this pillar:

----------

###  **1. Commitment from Leadership**

-   Senior management must actively support and participate in people development initiatives.
    
-   Development goals should align with the company's strategic objectives.
    

###  **2. Skills Matrix and Gap Analysis**

-   Create a **skills matrix** for all roles to understand current competencies.
    
-   Perform **gap analysis** to identify training needs at individual and team levels.
    

###  **3. Training Programs**

-   Design structured **training plans** (technical skills, soft skills, safety, problem-solving).
    
-   Use tools like **TWI (Training Within Industry)** or the **4-step method** (Prepare, Present, Try Out, Follow Up).
    

###  **4. Standard Work and Procedures**

-   Document standardized work processes to ensure consistency and ease of training.
    
-   Use visuals and SOPs to facilitate learning.
    

###  **5. Continuous Learning Culture**

-   Encourage a learning environment with **Kaizen** activities and regular knowledge-sharing sessions.
    
-   Implement **cross-training** to increase flexibility and team resilience.
    

### **6. Performance Measurement**

-   Track training hours, competency improvements, and application of skills on the shop floor.
    
-   Use KPIs like **training completion rate, multi-skilling index, and employee engagement scores**.
    

### **7. Career Path and Motivation**

-   Provide visible career development paths and recognize skill achievements.
    
-   Use **certifications or level badges** to motivate progression.
    

###  **8. Employee Involvement**

-   Engage workers in decision-making and problem-solving (e.g., through suggestion systems or improvement teams).
    
-   Implement systems for feedback and evaluation of training effectiveness.
    

## The People Development Application

PD is a technical aid for the assessment and development of skills in continuous improvement programs.

Strategic human resources management is the lever for achieving excellence. The People Development (PD) app promotes the development of skills of people working in the factory starting from the mapping of tasks and skills needed to carry out production activities. With the PD app, the skills of each worker are identified and assessed with a score; the values ​​recorded concern both the minimum skills required by the job and those detected by the evaluator. The deviations between the expected value and the assessed value, highlighted in a skills radar chart, allow the training needs of the worker to be assessed and training action to be planned to fill the skills gap.
