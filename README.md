# People Development
An open-source implementation of the "People Development" pillar of the World Class Manufacturing Protocol.

## Introduction

World Class Manufacturing (**WCM**) is a comprehensive, systematic approach to improve all aspects of a manufacturing operation. It focuses on continuous improvement, waste elimination, and achieving world-class production standards across all areas, from safety to customer service, and from equipment management to employee development. The goal is to achieve a "**zero waste**" state in terms of defects, downtime, accidents, and customer dissatisfaction. 

Here's a more detailed breakdown:

**Key Principles:**

 - **Continuous Improvement**: WCM emphasizes ongoing efforts to identify and eliminate waste, improve processes, and increase efficiency.
 - **Holistic Approach**: It encompasses all aspects of the manufacturing operation, from the shop floor to management practices. 
 - **Focus on the Customer:** WCM prioritizes meeting customer needs and expectations, ensuring on-time delivery and high-quality products. 
 - **Zero Waste**: The ultimate goal is to eliminate all forms of waste, including defects, downtime, accidents, and inventory, to achieve optimal efficiency and reduce costs. 
 - **Employee Involvement:** WCM encourages the active participation of all employees in identifying and implementing improvements. 

**Core Elements:**
WCM is often organized around 10 key pillars, including:

 1. Safety: Ensuring a safe working environment.  
 2. Cost Deployment:    Identifying and addressing cost-related losses.  
 3. Focus Improvement:   Implementing targeted improvement projects. 
 4. Autonomous Maintenance:   Empowering operators to maintain equipment.  
 5. Professional Maintenance: Implementing a structured maintenance program.  
 6. Quality  Control: Ensuring product quality through statistical process  control.
 7. Logistic/Customer Services: Managing supply chains and meeting customer needs.  
 8. Early Equipment Management: Making informed decisions about equipment purchases and maintenance.
 9. **People Development**: Investing in employee skills and training.
 10. Environment: Minimising environmental impact.

**7-Step Implementation Process:**
Each pillar is implemented through a 7-step process, moving from reactive to preventive and ultimately proactive approaches. 

The **People Development** pillar is one of the foundational elements of **World Class Manufacturing (WCM)**. It focuses on empowering and developing employees to support continuous improvement and operational excellence. 

Here's a breakdown of the **basic requirements** for implementing this pillar:

----------

###  **1. Commitment from Leadership**

-   Senior management must actively support and participate in people development initiatives.
    
-   Development goals should align with the company's strategic objectives.
    

###  **2. Skills Matrix and Gap Analysis**

-   Create a **skills matrix** for all roles to understand current competencies.
    
-   Perform **gap analysis** to identify training needs at individual and team levels.
    

###  **3. Training Programs**

-   Design structured **training plans** (technical skills, soft skills, safety, problem-solving).
    
-   Use tools like **TWI (Training Within Industry)** or the **4-step method** (Prepare, Present, Try Out, Follow Up).
    

###  **4. Standard Work and Procedures**

-   Document standardized work processes to ensure consistency and ease of training.
    
-   Use visuals and SOPs to facilitate learning.
    

###  **5. Continuous Learning Culture**

-   Encourage a learning environment with **Kaizen** activities and regular knowledge-sharing sessions.
    
-   Implement **cross-training** to increase flexibility and team resilience.
    

### **6. Performance Measurement**

-   Track training hours, competency improvements, and application of skills on the shop floor.
    
-   Use KPIs like **training completion rate, multi-skilling index, and employee engagement scores**.
    

### **7. Career Path and Motivation**

-   Provide visible career development paths and recognize skill achievements.
    
-   Use **certifications or level badges** to motivate progression.
    

###  **8. Employee Involvement**

-   Engage workers in decision-making and problem-solving (e.g., through suggestion systems or improvement teams).
    
-   Implement systems for feedback and evaluation of training effectiveness.
    

## The People Development Web App

PD Wev App is a technical aid for assessing and developing skills in continuous improvement programs.

Strategic human resources management is the lever for achieving excellence. The People Development (PD) app promotes the development of skills of people working in the factory starting from the mapping of tasks and skills needed to carry out production activities. With the PD app, the skills of each worker are identified and assessed with a score; the values â€‹â€‹recorded concern both the minimum skills required by the job and those detected by the evaluator. The deviations between the expected value and the assessed value, highlighted in a skills radar chart, allow the worker's training needs to be assessed and training action to be planned to fill the skills gap.

In **World Class Manufacturing (WCM)**, **HERCA** and effective **Ways to Teach People** are central to the **People Development** pillar. Hereâ€™s how they fit in:

----------

#### **HERCA â€“ Hierarchical Evaluation and Recognition of Competence and Ability**

HERCA is a structured method used in WCM to assess and develop employee skills.

#### **Key Aspects of HERCA:**

1.  **Hierarchical Evaluation**:
    
    -   Skills are ranked based on levels of competence (e.g., from beginner to expert).
        
    -   Each level has defined criteria for knowledge, execution, teaching ability, and problem-solving.
        
2.  **Competency Ladder**:
    
    -   Often shown in a **skills matrix**, mapping each worker's level against required skills.
        
    -   Promotes **multi-skilling** and a clear development path.
        
3.  **Recognition**:
    
    -   Achievements are visibly acknowledged (e.g., skill badges, certificates, wall boards).
        
    -   Motivates employees and aligns with the principle of respect for people.
        
4.  **Personal Development Plan (PDP)**:
    
    -   Created for each worker to close skill gaps and advance to the next level.
        
    -   Monitored regularly by team leaders or supervisors.
        

----------

#### **The Way to Teach People â€“ TWI & 4-Step Method**

Training must be structured and effective. WCM encourages using standard methods like:

**TWI (Training Within Industry) â€“ Job Instruction (JI)**

A proven method for teaching skills on the shop floor.

1.  **Prepare the Worker**
    
    -   Put them at ease, ensure theyâ€™re ready to learn.
        
2.  **Present the Operation**
    
    -   Break it into key steps and explain why each step is important.
        
3.  **Try Out Performance**
    
    -   Let the learner try, correct errors gently, and reinforce good habits.
        
4.  **Follow Up**
    
    -   Check progress, offer support, and encourage improvement.
        

#### ðŸ§¾ **Standardized Teaching Aids**

-   Use **visuals, one-point lessons (OPLs)**, and **job breakdown sheets** to support teaching.
    
-   Lessons should be **short, focused, and repeatable**.
